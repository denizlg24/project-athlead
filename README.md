# project-dvco

> A modern platform for leaders and teams to set goals, track progress, and share wins â€” built for simplicity, transparency, and motivation.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project aims to create a **leadership and team performance platform** where users can define objectives, share updates, give feedback, and recognize achievements in an engaging, collaborative way. The focus is on real communication and progress â€” not vanity metrics.

## ðŸ§± Architecture

* **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router, Server Components, TailwindCSS)
* **Backend:** [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) with [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM)
* **Infra:** Turborepo + Docker + optional microservices for scalable modules
* **Auth:** NextAuth.js (OAuth, credentials, or SSO)
* **Messaging:** WebSockets (real-time updates)

The setup is flexible â€” small teams can start with a single repo, while larger orgs can scale out each service independently.
